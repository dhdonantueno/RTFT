# RTFT
Raspberry Pi library for video output UTFT compatible.

  RTFT.cpp - Raspberry Pi library for video output.
  Copyright (C)2015 Daniel Donantueno. All right reserved
  
  This library is an adaptation of the popular UTFT.cpp 
  Arduino/chipKit library support for Color TFT LCD Boards by 
  Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. Frame Buffer handing
  for the Raspberry Pi platform is based on comments found 
  in http://raspberrycompote.blogspot.com.ar.
  
  Due to the popularity of UTFT library I felt it would be nice to
  adapt that library in order to allow Arduino programs to work on 
  the Raspberry pi platform.

  This library is based in the Frame Buffer technology wich allows
  a very good performance and ease of work.
